# The Pasilla dataset

This data set is from an experiment on _Drosophila melanogaster_ cell cultures and
investigated the effect of RNAi knock-down of the splicing factor _pasilla_
([Brooks et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.108662.110)). The detailed
transcript of the production of the pasilla data is provided in the vignette of 
the data package
[pasilla](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/pasilla.html).

Differential gene expression analysis comparing treated and untreated samples
was carried out using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html),
as described in the package [vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html).
