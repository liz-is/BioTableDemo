**Gene ID**: Flybase gene ID.
**Mean expression**: The average of the normalized count values, dividing by size factors, taken over all samples.
**Log2 fold change (treated vs untreated)**: The effect size estimate. This value indicates how much the gene or transcript's expression seems to have changed between the comparison and control groups. This value is reported on a logarithmic scale with base 2.
**Standard error of log2 fold change**: The standard error estimate for the log2 fold change estimate.
**Test statistic**: The value of the test statistic for the gene.
**P-value**: P-value of the test for the gene.
**Adjusted p-value**: P-value of the test for the gene, after adjusting for multiple testing.
